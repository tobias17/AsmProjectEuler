# Asm Project Euler

This is a personal project is for solving the programming problems on [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/archives) in x86 assembly.

The goal of undertaking this project was solely for me to familiarize myself with x86 assembly and, while I have put some effort into optimizing some solutions, this is more about getting working solutions than to get the fastest ones possible.
